Yes, this is yet another coding agent leveraging LLMs, **and it is at an early development stage**.

But there are a few things that make it different, and hopefully interesting:

## Interactive without a chat interface.

An interactive UI is important not only for a delightful UX but also for agent performance, as it enables more human feedback and context. However, we aim to achieve this without using chat as the primary interface.

## Real-time and multi-player support.

Fastrepl was built from day one with real-time and multi-player in mind, which is why most of the code is written in Elixir. Real-time progress updates from the agent will make the system highly responsive. Multi-player support will become more exciting as we move toward more long-running agents, and this type of devtool is adapted to larger teams.

## Augmenting rather than replacing.

Ranking high on SWEBench is not our aim. Rather than occasionally solving problems while consuming more resources, it is preferable to reliably create a good starting point that humans can take over from.
